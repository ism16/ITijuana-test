def question_1(x: int, y: int) -> List[int]:
    '''
    Write a function that takes two integers (x and y) and returns a list of numbers between x and y that are divisible by 5 but not by 7.

    Answer = Bewteen x and y is a key factor, thus, this is a not inclusive range, x and y cannot be in list.

    Write a function that takes two numbers (x and y) as input and returns the value to the following function:
    
    Answer = There is not funtcion in the pdf. I assume it refers to function 3, for this, instead of taking two arguments, 
    I will make use of python built-in inputs to built a CLI and then call function 3.

def question_3(x: int, y: int) -> List[int]:
    '''
    Write a function that takes two integers (x and b) as inputs and returns a string that represents the number x in base b
    Example 1: if x=5 and b=2 then the function will return "101"
    Example 2: if x=5 and b=3 then the function will return "12"
